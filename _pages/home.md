Hi, I'm Robin and this is my personal website.

I'm a software engineer living near Zurich, Switzerland and I'm graduating with a Bachelor of Science.
I love to tinker with technology, like playing around with Linux, discovering new programming languages and prototyping some new ideas with Python.

You can see a few of my projects and experiments on the [Projects](/projects) page.

If you want to get in touch with me, use any of the links in the sidebar.
