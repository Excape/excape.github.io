I publish all my code from my projects and experiments to my <i class="fab fa-github"></i> [GitHub](https://github.com/Excape){:target="blank"} page.

Here I'll highlight some things I've been working on:

## Projects

[<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/public-transport-quality-grades) **Public Transport Quality Grades (2018)**

This is my just finished bachelor thesis. It's about grading public transport service in Switzerland. We created a new specification and implemented a CLI tool using Python to generate the gradings, which can be visualized inside a React application.

Technologies: <i class="fab fa-python"></i> Python, Flask, <i class="fab fa-react"></i> React
