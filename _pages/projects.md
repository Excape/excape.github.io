I publish all my code from my projects and experiments to my <i class="fab fa-github"></i> [GitHub](https://github.com/Excape){:target="blank"} page.

Here I'll highlight some things I've been working on:

## Projects

### [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/public-transport-quality-grades){:target="blank"} Public Transport Quality Grades (2018)

This is my just finished bachelor thesis. It's about grading public transport service in Switzerland. We created a new specification and implemented a CLI tool using Python to generate the gradings, which can be visualized inside a React application.

Technologies: <i class="fab fa-python"></i> Python, Flask, <i class="fab fa-react"></i> React, <i class="fas fa-database"></i> PostgreSQL, PostGIS

### [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/plazaroute){:target="blank"} PlazaRoute (2017)

This was my student research project. We used data from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org){:target="blank"} and improved on pedestrian routing through open areas by calculating shortest paths through them.

Technologies: <i class="fab fa-python"></i> Python, Flask

### [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/examibur){:target="blank"} Examibur (2017)

This was an engineering project for my studies. We created a web application to grade and review exams. It was also an exercise in using SCRUM in a team of 4 people.

Technologies: <i class="fab fa-java"></i> Java, Java Spark, <i class="fas fa-database"></i> PostgreSQL

### [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/Excape?tab=repositories&q=hsr-docs){:target="blank"} HSR Study Notes (2016 - 2018)

From my second semester at [HSR](http://hsr.ch){:target="blank"} onward, I wrote all my notes for my classes in Markdown and built a static website using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/){:target="blank"}. That way, I always had a nicely formatted site of my notes without any overhead.

The websites are all still online:

* [Spring Semester 2016](https://robinsuter.ch/hsr-docs-fs16/){:target="blank"}
* [Fall Semester 2016](https://robinsuter.ch/hsr-docs-hs16/){:target="blank"}
* [Spring Semester 2017](https://robinsuter.ch/hsr-docs-fs17/){:target="blank"}
* [Fall Semester 2017](https://robinsuter.ch/hsr-docs-hs17/){:target="blank"}
* [Spring Semester 2018](https://robinsuter.ch/hsr-docs-fs18/){:target="blank"}

Technologies: Markdown, MkDocs, Travis CI

### [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/openhsr/connect){:target="blank"} Open\HSR Connect (2016)

With our group of Open Source enthusiasts ([Open\HSR](https://www.openhsr.ch/){:target="blank"}) we created a Python application to handle the common tasks in our university more easily (specifially on Linux machines), like installing a printer or downloading the lecture slides.
My contribution was a file synchronisation between the remote file server and the local computer.
