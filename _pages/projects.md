I publish all my code from my personal projects to my <i class="fab fa-github"></i> [GitHub](https://github.com/Excape){:target="blank"} page.

Here I'll highlight some things I've been working on:

## Projects

### [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/excape/ynab-splitter){:target="blank"} YNAB Splitter
[YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/){:target="blank"} ("You Need a Budget") is a personal financing tool I've been using with my wife. Since we're sharing a credit card, it was annoying to keep separate budgets in sync.
I created YNAB splitter as a web application to assist in sorting through credit card transactions and splitting them between us. It was also a good chance to try out principles from "Clean Architecture". I have created a tech talk about it [here](https://github.com/Excape/clean-architecture-talk){:target="blank"}.

Technologies: <i class="fab fa-react"></i> React, Kotlin, Spring Boot, MongoDB

### [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/Excape/camp-werwoelfle){:target="blank"} Werw√∂lfle (2019)
Built during a Hackathon, we implemented a version of the party game "Werewolf" where players could create or join a game in real-time. The web application acted as a game moderator and players would vote and make decisions in the app.

Technologies: <i class="fab fa-angular"></i> Angular, Spring Boot

### [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/public-transport-quality-grades){:target="blank"} Public Transport Quality Grades (2018)

This is my just finished bachelor thesis. It's about grading public transport service in Switzerland. We created a new specification and implemented a CLI tool using Python to generate the gradings, which can be visualized inside a React application.

Technologies: <i class="fab fa-python"></i> Python, Flask, <i class="fab fa-react"></i> React, <i class="fas fa-database"></i> PostgreSQL, PostGIS

### [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/plazaroute){:target="blank"} PlazaRoute (2017)

This was my student research project. We used data from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org){:target="blank"} and improved on pedestrian routing through open areas by calculating shortest paths through them.

Technologies: <i class="fab fa-python"></i> Python, Flask

### [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/examibur){:target="blank"} Examibur (2017)

This was an engineering project for my studies. We created a web application to grade and review exams. It was also an exercise in using SCRUM in a team of 4 people.

Technologies: <i class="fab fa-java"></i> Java, Java Spark, <i class="fas fa-database"></i> PostgreSQL

### [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/Excape?tab=repositories&q=hsr-docs){:target="blank"} HSR Study Notes (2016 - 2018)

From my second semester at [HSR](http://hsr.ch){:target="blank"} onward, I wrote all my notes for my classes in Markdown and built a static website using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/){:target="blank"}. That way, I always had a nicely formatted site of my notes without any overhead.

The websites are all still online:

* [Spring Semester 2016](https://robinsuter.ch/hsr-docs-fs16/){:target="blank"}
* [Fall Semester 2016](https://robinsuter.ch/hsr-docs-hs16/){:target="blank"}
* [Spring Semester 2017](https://robinsuter.ch/hsr-docs-fs17/){:target="blank"}
* [Fall Semester 2017](https://robinsuter.ch/hsr-docs-hs17/){:target="blank"}
* [Spring Semester 2018](https://robinsuter.ch/hsr-docs-fs18/){:target="blank"}

Technologies: Markdown, MkDocs, Travis CI

### [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/openhsr/connect){:target="blank"} Open\HSR Connect (2016)

With our group of Open Source enthusiasts ([Open\HSR](https://www.openhsr.ch/){:target="blank"}) we created a Python application to handle the common tasks in our university more easily (specifially on Linux machines), like installing a printer or downloading the lecture slides.
My contribution was a file synchronisation between the remote file server and the local computer.
